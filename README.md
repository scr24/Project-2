# Project-2
Created by Sean Rogawski and Nicholas Kafarski

This project is designed to teach us how our information is collected on the web. While sometimes that can benefit us, other times it's harmful. We'll cover some cases where 
that data is used and how you can choose to remain anonymous if you don't see benefit. Having a modern design and feel, this is best presented for the average internet user, 
and young adults in general.
