<div class="container-fluid text-center">    
    <div class="row content">
        <div class="col-sm-8 text-left" style="padding-left: 150px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
            
            <h1 style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px ">Facebook</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> Facebook itself asks you for a lot of you personal information. You give them 
                a lot of basic information such as full name and birth dates. The issue is when you give them the extra information such as your hometown or phone 
                number. This information is not out there on the internet and in the hands of Facebook as well. 
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> Facebook also collects other information about you from your likes and viewing 
                history. All of the pages you like help build the advertisement persona that businesses seek. In tandem with all of the information you already 
                give Facebook, they have a wealth of personal data on you that they keep collecting to turn a profit. This profit led to them collecting as much 
                information as possible. They have the potential to tell you your favorite shopping stores, your location, and possibly even your typical driving 
                routes. 
            </p>

            <h1 style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px ">Fingerprinting</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> A new problem many privacy experts are alerting masses about is the browser 
                fingerprint. A browser fingerprint is the term used to refer to the trace that your exact web browser is leaving behind. This trail left 
                behind can leave information about yourself, more specifically your web browser itself, discoverable to others. All of this information is 
                collected through Javascript. Javascript requires a lot of information about your computer system to run properly, which is why it can be so 
                dangerous to use unprotected. These fingerprints can let third parties know what web browser you are using, the operating system, the screen 
                resolution, the default language, the time zone, active web extensions- a lot of your information.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> There are a number of ways to counter browser fingerprinting. One way is to 
                change the browser you are using to something more secure, such as Firefox 72 or Tor. Firefox 72 was released in January 2020 and has features 
                to specifically block fingerprinting, and Tor Browser itself is already a very secure and discrete browser. To ensure that these browsers stop 
                fingerprinting, make sure to turn off Javascript entirely, especially if using Tor. Javascript is how these traces are left behind, so turning 
                it off entirely will greatly aid your cause. 
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> A big part of stopping fingerprinting is being aware of it. Not enough 
                people are aware of fingerprinting at the moment, which makes it that much more dangerous. A good idea would be to tell your friends and family 
                about its potential dangers in order to potentially save them in the future.
