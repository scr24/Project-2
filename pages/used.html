  <div class="meat">Did you ever think your information was vital to others? It can be quite the hot commodity. We will discuss two situations, one where a company profits 
      from your information and another where your data is used to teach machines.</div>
  </div>

    <div class="row content">
        <div class="col-sm-8 text-left" style="padding-left: 150px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
            
            <h1 style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px">Facebook Profits</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> In the beginning of 2012, Facebook had about five months before they went 
                public on the stock market. One of their main goals was to prove how profitable Facebook was as a company. Facebook’s main generation of revenue
                was through targeted advertisements on their website; these ads worked so well because Facebook was able to target individuals more personally 
                based on the personal data they collect via Facebook “likes” and viewing history. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> But Facebook was going to step it up a notch. Facebook had collaborated with 
                many data collecting agencies in order to better understand the wants and needs of each individual. These data collecting agencies gave Facebook 
                information about users far past their name and birthday. They analyzed trends of each individual, and could accurately list their location, 
                their favorite stores, their habits, their driving route, and much, much more. It is scary how much information these social media websites 
                could hold. Because of this enhanced data collection, Facebook ad revenue skyrocketed, leading to a very successful IPO.

            <h1 style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px ">Lookalike Modeling Machine Learning</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> In order to find a wider audience to target ads towards, many companies will 
                utilize Lookalike Modeling Machine Learning. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> What this specific machine learning does is analyze the behaviors of as many 
                users as possible. Once the data is collected, a profile can be created for each individual user based on stereotypes in their behavior. For 
                example, many people who buy basketballs online would most likely be profiled as basketball fans, which means these users would most likely be 
                susceptible to NBA advertisements. There is no proof that these hypothetical people would be NBA fans nor that they are basketball fans at 
                all. Regardless, machine learning recognizes their viewing and spending habits as a basketball fan. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> In the instance of Lookalike Modeling Machine Learning, machine learning is 
                trying to find people whose online behavior is similar to those who are susceptible to advertisements. Let’s say hypothetically that 10% of 
                people clicked on a specific ad campaign. These 10% would have their profiles examined through machine learning, and the machine learning would 
                try to find people who also matched these descriptions that have not been targeted yet. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> Along with this, machine learning is constantly updating its description of 
                the “optimal user”. As more people click on the advertisement, more and more information is learned about both the users themselves and the 
                trends of which types of people are more likely to click these ads in the first place. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Verdana'; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> Machine Learning is why when you click an ad once you are more likely to see 
                it over and over again. You have shown interest in the ad once, and therefore machine learning believes you have an interest in the subject. 
                Machine learning is only growing more powerful, and soon companies will be able to know what you want before you may even know yourself.
